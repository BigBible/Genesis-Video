# Genesis Project Dialog

Last Update: 19 June 2022

**Daughter:**

Hi dad, how was your work at the hospital?

**Dad:**

Pretty good, honey, how are your classes in junior high going?

**Daughter:**

OK, I guess.

**Dad:**

What do you mean, “I guess”. Is something wrong?

**Daughter:**

Well, we've been studying evolution in our science class. They said that it all happened based on chance, like someone throwing some dice. Is that right? I mean, didn’t God have some part in it? That’s what our pastor says and what you and mom have always taught me.

**Dad:**

Yes, honey, we taught you that God is our Creator and the Creator of nature. Your mother and I knew that this day would come when some of your teachers would start telling you something different. So, we made some preparation beforehand. We wanted to show you some of the reasons that we believe that God created our world and gave us the Bible to help us. And as a physician, you know that I have thought a lot about science. Would you like to spend some time going over what your mother and I have prepared?

**Daughter:**

Sure, dad. We have about half an hour before dinner. Do you think that is enough time? I really would like to understand more.

**Dad:**

We would also be so pleased to help you understand – where we came from and why we are here. These are some pretty big questions, but at some point in most people's lives, they start asking these questions. And it looks like that time for you might be now.

**Daughter:**

I think it might be now, too, dad. My teachers and my friends sometimes say things that I don't understand. So, I know that you and mom love me and I love you. I would like to hear what you think about all these big questions.

**Dad:**

You always have had such a good heart, Leticia, and I am so thankful that you want to hear what we have to say. So, we made a short presentation. Are you ready to see what we have prepared?

**Daughter:**

Sure, dad. I know that you like to work with graphics at your job, so this should be fun to see what you have.

**Dad:**

I hope that you like it. Let’s start then at the beginning of the Bible, with the first chapter of Genesis. This is a one page summary of how God created everything. How does that sound?

**Daughter:**

That sounds great, dad. Of course, I have read the first chapter of Genesis before, but I would like to understand how it relates to what my science teacher is telling me.

**Dad:**

Well, Leticia, you may see some differences. But nature and the Bible were both created by the same God. So, in the end that is why science and the Bible *will be* in agreement when we understand them both correctly.

**Daughter:**

That makes sense.

**Dad:**

Yes, as it should. So, let’s start with the first part of the first verse in the Bible.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   When God began creating the heavens …

Now I have to explain something first of all. Genesis was written over 3000 years ago in the Hebrew language. They only had about NNN nouns in Hebrew at that time, so many of their words can be translated into different words in our English language, because we have NNNN nouns in English. So, when the verse says, “the heavens”, that can mean what we now call the universe. So, this verse is saying that in the beginning, God created the whole universe.

**Daughter:**

That makes sense. That is what I have always heard in church and at home.

**Dad:**

Yes, and from science we now know that there was a time over 13 billion years ago when the universe actually did have a beginning.

**Daughter:**

Wow! That is a long time ago.

**Dad:**

Yes, it certainly is. But scientists have been able to figure out many of these details from even that far back in time.

Here’s a short video of what happened over 13 billion years ago up until about 4 and a half billion years ago.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   Video of Big Bang up to creation of earth / 13.7 to 4.5 billion years ago

**Note that for all of the videos showing creation days, at the bottom of the screen the time period will be displayed as a timeline. Perhaps there will be an arrow or something that also denotes the time flow as the video changes.**

And before that beginning, science tells us that time and space did not even exist.

**Daughter:**

No time or space? Wow, that is pretty hard to think about.

**Dad:**

It certainly is and I am not sure any of us can really comprehend that. That is one thing that makes the Bible so unique. The Bible is the only religious book that talks about God as a Creator that is outside of nature, outside of time and space. The general name that we have for the start of creation is the Big Bang.

**Daughter:**

So, science can really tell us that – that before the Big Bang there was no time and space?

**Dad:**

Yes, that comes from a deep understanding of a theory from the great scientist named Einstein.

**Daughter:**

I have heard of Einstein. But aren’t his theories pretty complicated? Is this going to be over my head?

**Dad:**

The details can get complicated. But the beauty of the explanation in Genesis is that God puts it in language that everyone can understand at some level. Then the scientists can probe into matters more deeply for all of the details.

OK, so we understand that the first sentence of the Bible tells us that God created the universe. And then it goes on to say…

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   When God began creating the heavens **and the earth**,

So here is where the first chapter of Genesis makes an important switch. After the creation of the universe, we are now going to focus on the earth and what the earth was like in the beginning.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   Genesis 1:2a the earth was a shapeless, chaotic mass:

So we have a video of this disorderly state of the earth at the beginning.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   Video of beginning of the earth in chaos

**Daughter:**

Wow, it really did look like a mess, didn’t it?

**Dad:**

Yes, it did. And then the last part of this verse makes it even more clear that this is now a story about the earth as seen from God’s Spirit.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   Genesis 1:2 the earth was a shapeless, chaotic mass **with the Spirit of God brooding over the dark vapors**.

So, in this video we show the Spirit of God like a fiery dove moving over the face of these dark vapors or waters.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   Video of the fiery dove / Spirit hovering over the waters

**Daughter:**

Was the earth covered in water like that in the beginning? And was it all dark like that?

**Dad:**

Yes, exactly, scientists now understand that unlike many other planets, earth was covered in water near the very beginning. And scientists understand that the atmosphere was very dark because of the dense clouds covering the earth. It’s really something that the Bible describes what happened 4.5 billion years ago so accurately. After all, scientists didn't discover these facts until about 100 years ago or less. But this description in Genesis was written over 3000 years ago, way before any person knew all these details.

**Daughter:**

Wow! So, what happens next?

**Dad:**

What happens next is referred to as the first day of creation.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   Genesis 1:3-5 Then God said, “Let there be light.” And light appeared.  And God was pleased with it and divided the light from the darkness. He called the light “daytime,” and the darkness “nighttime.” Together they formed the first day.

Now remember what we said about Genesis being written in Hebrew and that there were only about NNN nouns in ancient Hebrew?

**Daughter:**

Yes

**Dad:**

Well, the word that is translated as “day” here is the Hebrew word *yom* and can be translated also in other ways. Sometimes *yom* means a long period of time, as in some of the following verses.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   Reference to verse example(s) for yom being long period of time

So, it does not necessarily mean that each creation day was a 24 hour period. So, with that understanding, let’s see what is happening during this time period of day 1, or “yom 1”.

We know that the story is from the Spirit of God hovering or brooding over the waters of the earth. And we know that the clouds made the atmosphere very dark. So, can you guess what this verse might mean – when God said, “Let there be light”. Can you guess what science may have found out about what happened?

**Daughter:**

Well, could that mean that somehow the atmosphere became light instead of dark?

**Dad:**

Excellent guess! I think we have a budding scientist on our hands.

That’s exactly right. Scientists found that after the dark cloud cover that formed over the earth, then a secondary atmosphere formed from Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide???

Here’s a video that shows how the earth’s atmosphere might have looked from about 4.5 billion years ago to about 2.5? billion years ago.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   Video of the earth atmosphere becoming translucent while the fiery dove representing the Spirit of God hovers in the atmosphere

**Daughter:**

So the first day was about 2 billion years long? That was a long day, wasn’t it?

**Dad:**

Yes, it was. But remember that God didn’t have a lot of words to work with when He made this one page summary of creation. So, sometimes He has to cover a lot of ground in explaining things with a few words.

**Daughter:**

So, what happened next?

**Dad:**

Good question. Let’s read what the Bible says.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   Genesis 1:6-8  And God said, “Let the vapors separate to form the sky above and the oceans below.” So God made the sky, dividing the vapor above from the water below. This all happened on the second day.

**Daughter:**

So, this is when God made the sky?

**Dad:**

Exactly. Here is a short video that shows how that might have happened.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   Video of the earth atmosphere evolving into a sky while the fiery dove representing the Spirit of God hovers in the sky

**Daughter:**

Wow, this is pretty easy to understand, isn’t it?

**Dad:**

Yes, it really is. So, are you ready for the next day?

**Daughter:**

Sure.

**Dad:**

OK. Here is how Genesis describes day 3.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]  
>     
>   Genesis 1:9-13 Then God said, “Let the water beneath the sky be gathered into oceans so that the dry land will emerge.” And so it was. Then God named the dry land “earth,” and the water “seas.” And God was pleased. And he said, “Let the earth burst forth with every sort of grass and seed-bearing plant, and fruit trees with seeds inside the fruit, so that these seeds will produce the kinds of plants and fruits they came from.” And so it was, and God was pleased.  This all occurred on the third day.

**Daughter:**

So, where did the land come from? I thought that the earth was just covered with water.

**Dad:**

Yes, you are really listening well, Leticia. I always appreciated that you really try to understand.

**Daughter:**

Thanks, Dad.

**Dad:**

Thank you, honey. So, here again the scientists can help us with the details about exactly how all of these things happened. The earth was covered in water, but then beneath the water there was all sorts of rocks, just like there is now at the bottom of the ocean. So, the rocks began moving around and pushing up through the ocean to form the land that we now live on. And then after that, plants began to grow on the land. Let’s see a short video of what that might have looked like.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   Video of the land appearing from beneath the seas and then the vegetation beginning to grow on the land while the fiery dove representing the Spirit of God hovers in the sky

**Daughter:**

It’s beginning to look more like the earth that we live on.

**Dad:**

Yes, God was preparing the earth for us to be here. But the clouds were still pretty dark, so in the next time period of day 4, God makes it so that there are fewer clouds. Now the sun and moon can be seen in the sky and the earth can have days and nights more like what we are used to. Here is how it is described in Genesis.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   Genesis 1:14-19. Then God said, “Let bright lights appear in the sky to give light to the earth and to identify the day and the night; they shall bring about the seasons on the earth, and mark the days and years.” And so it was.  For God had made two huge lights, the sun and moon, to shine down upon the earth—the larger one, the sun, to preside over the day and the smaller one, the moon, to preside through the night; he had also made the stars. And God set them in the sky to light the earth, and to preside over the day and night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God was pleased.  This all happened on the fourth day.

**Daughter:**

So, do you have a video for the fourth day also?

**Dad:**

I certainly do, Leticia. You are a step ahead of me. Here it is.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   Video of the clouds dissipating and the sun and moon showing in the sky while the fiery dove representing the Spirit of God hovers in the sky

**Daughter:**

If I remember correctly, it seems like somewhere around this time doesn’t God start making the animals?

**Dad:**

Very good memory, honey. You always were good at memorizing the Bible. Genesis says that God started with creatures in the sea for the fifth day.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   Genesis 1:20-23. Then God said, “Let the waters teem with fish and other life, and let the skies be filled with birds of every kind.” So God created great sea animals, and every sort of fish and every kind of bird. And God looked at them with pleasure, and blessed them all. “Multiply and stock the oceans,” he told them, and to the birds he said, “Let your numbers increase. Fill the earth!” That ended the fifth day.

This is the period of time when scientists can date many of the fossils, like we see in the museums.

**Daughter:**

Is this the time when the dinosaurs lived?

**Dad:**

Yes, this period of time probably covers many different life forms, including the dinosaurs. Remember, Genesis is just giving us a short summary so many details are not included. Also, God probably didn’t want to confuse people by describing creatures that we wouldn’t know anything about for thousands of years. So, Genesis talks about things that people in all times could benefit from. Here’s the video that summarizes many of the changes that took place in this fifth creation day.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   Video of different life forms evolving, beginning with the Cambrian explosion, and continuing through dinosaurs and mammals and then birds, while the fiery dove representing the Spirit of God hovers in the sky

**Daughter:**

Wow, that was pretty cool!

**Dad:**

Yes, and you know about the sixth day of creation also. God begins the sixth day with creation of some different types of animals. And then God finishes the day with the crown of His creation - people like you and me. God chose to make us in His own image.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   Genesis 1:24-31. And God said, “Let the earth bring forth every kind of animal—cattle and reptiles and wildlife of every kind.” And so it was. God made all sorts of wild animals and cattle and reptiles. And God was pleased with what he had done.

>   Then God said, “Let us make a man—someone like ourselves, to be the master of all life upon the earth and in the skies and in the seas.”

>   So God made man like his Maker.  
>   Like God did God make man;  
>   Man and maid did he make them.

>   And God blessed them and told them, “Multiply and fill the earth and subdue it; you are masters of the fish and birds and all the animals. And look! I have given you the seed-bearing plants throughout the earth and all the fruit trees for your food.  And I’ve given all the grass and plants to the animals and birds for their food.”  Then God looked over all that he had made, and it was excellent in every way. This ended the sixth day.

**Daughter:**

I am really looking forward to the video of this sixth creation day.

**Dad:**

Yes, it is very interesting because scientists have figured out so many of the details about what happened during this time period. As with so much of science, we are continually finding out new things and revising the theories. But what is really amazing is that the descriptions in Genesis have been found so far to match very well what the scientists are finding. So, here is the video for the sixth day of creation.

>   [Zoom in to computer screen]

>   Video of the domesticated animals and reptiles and wildlife being created. Then show the creation of Adam and Eve, while the fiery dove representing the Spirit of God hovers in the sky

**Daughter:**

Those are really cool videos, dad. This makes a lot of sense. 

But if God was creating all of these things along the way, then why does my science teacher say that it was evolution that made all these changes? Is God the same as evolution?

**Dad:**

That’s a very important question, Leticia. The short answer is “No, they are not the same”. At the same time, scientists have shown us that evolution does occur and explains many changes that have occurred over the past millions of years. So, it appears that God designed this evolutionary process as part of His creation. However, there are certain parts of our history that most scientists agree cannot be explained very well using theories of evolution. For example, for the fifth creation day, the fish and other creatures appeared much more quickly than the theories of evolution would predict. Also, the creation of the first humans with all of our vast abilities on the sixth creation day cannot be explained very well by the theories of evolution. 

I believe that theories of evolution will never explain many of these key events in the history of humans and of the earth. And that means that the best overall explanation for human and earth history will continue to be the one that we have in this first chapter of Genesis, as well as some other sections in the Bible that we didn’t really have time to cover here. 

And, honey, I just want to leave you with this very important thought. One of the special things about this description in Genesis is that it was written over 3000 years ago, before we had any idea of these scientific discoveries. But the descriptions in Genesis still match the actual events that took place. How can we explain the fact that these descriptions match the actual events that go back over 4 and a half billion years, way before mankind even existed? The most reasonable explanation is that the Creator of the universe is also the author of Genesis in some way. And knowing that our Creator is the author of Genesis gives us a lot of confidence that the rest of the Bible is reliable as well, including the Good News of salvation through Jesus. 

**Daughter:**

Wow, I feel a little overwhelmed by all this information. In some ways it's so simple, but in some ways it seems like some of the deepest things that I could ever think about.

**Dad:**

Yes, I totally agree with you, honey. It would probably be good to ponder these things some more as your mind and heart lead you. And always, please feel free to come back and ask me any questions that you might have. If you give me enough time, I may even be able to come up with some more videos that visualize the answers to your questions.

**Daughter:**

Sounds great, dad. And we made it in time for dinner! Yea! Mom will be pleased.

**Dad:**

Yes, I think she will be pleased for many reasons.

**Daughter:**

Thanks dad for all of this. I love you.

**Dad:**

Thank you for being such a great daughter, Leticia. I love you too.

**Daughter:**

**Dad:**
