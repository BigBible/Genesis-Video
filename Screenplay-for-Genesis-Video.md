# Screenplay for Genesis Video

Last Update: 29-April-2022 

This is a rough screenplay for an artistic interpretation of the first 2 chapters of Genesis. The primary inspiration is from the works from the Reasons to Believe explanations at https://reasons.org and their many associated books. This video will present a visualization the creation of the universe and how it is described in broad strokes quite accurately by the account given in Genesis 1. The video can borrow ideas from many of the wonderful animations that have already been made that visualize the earlier stages of the universe. But since this will be based on an open source project with a generous license (e.g., MIT or perhaps Creative Commons) then we would want to have the assets either be original or from assets with compatible licenses. We want to show the evolution of the universe and the earth from the beginning of the big bang up through the creation of man. As this video shows the process, then the words of Genesis will display and will be timed to coincide with the video. It would be good to have both a long form (approximately 30 min to an hour) and a short version (approximately 5 minutes to 20 minutes). This can be posted originally on the Big Bible channel of YouTube.

## Introduction

This part of the video is a brief introduction about what the video is all about. Since it is a movie explanation and not a literary explanation, so it needs to be short and to the point. The screen is divided up into 2 sections with a vertical divider on each site. A possible layout is as follows.

## The Right Bible Pane


Somewhere in this process on the right panel, there should be a special section for passages from Genesis. While there should be several Scriptures in the right panel that appear that relate to the visualization that is being displayed, the overall sequence in the visualization will be driven by the passages from Genesis. For example, at the beginning of the presentation, the middle screen is totally black, the right panel with the Genesis section shows the passage from Genesis 1:1 &quot;In the beginning&quot; and the left panel says something to the effect of it being before time and space began. Then in the right panel beneath the Genesis section (assuming that the Genesis section is on the top), there could be the following Scriptures. Then the Genesis section shows the following. **In the beginning, God created** The left pane could show a small bright dot. The left pane could say something about the singularity, the beginning of space and time, the beginning of the &quot;big bang&quot;. And so forth.

**Day 4** 
*Visualization display*: Shows the second great oxygenation event. This means more clearing of the cloud cover and the daily earth rotation cycle beginning on the earth. Show how the sun and the moon were then visible from the surface of the earth.

Genesis Section: **And God said, &quot;Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years, and let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth.&quot; And it was so. And God made the two great lights—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night—and the stars. And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth, to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.**
